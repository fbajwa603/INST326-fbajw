Week 1: This week I used to to help with some of my python exercises. I used it to help me understand how to format strings and work with booleans. For Example I got help with aligning shelf labels and normalizing IBSN numbers. I also used AI to help me link my repository. 

Week 2: This week I used AI while working through Python exercises. It helped me double check my use of loops and conditionals, and I asked for examples when I wasn’t sure about slicing and list operations. I also used it to clean up some of my code formatting and to make quick summaries of my class notes for review.

Week 3: This week I used AI to work through more advanced Python exercises, especially the ones involving lists and functions. It helped me fix errors in my swap and checkout functions by explaining why my variables weren’t defined correctly. 

Week 4: This week I used AI to help me figure out question 10. I typed in my code for question 10 but I was constantly getting an error. After a little while of trying to change my code and get it to work it still wasn't working so I used AI to see what was going wrong. It turns out that my code was right, but the paremeter for the question was wrong. So i changed the parameter in the question and re-ran the question and it ended up working. 

Week 5: This week I used AI to help me fill in missing parts of exercises such as MembershipPolicy, Loan, BookCopy, and Settings. I also used AI to double-check my work by showing my screenshots and asking if my code output was correct. This was helpful because it confirmed I understood each exercise and applied best practices.

Week 6: This week I used Ai to help me write and debug codes for classes like Book, Member, LoanPolicy, and Library. I also used it to understand error messages and fix problems with imports and identation. 

Week 7: This week I used AI to help me e write and fix code for error handling, file reading, and unit testing. I also used it to understand why certain coding practices are better, like not using broad exceptions.

Week 8: This week I used AI to help me understand how to use classes and inheritance in Python for a library system. It guided me in building different book types like printed, digital, and audio books, and showed how they work together. AI also made it easier to check that my code worked the right way.
